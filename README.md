# Mint-NFT
Project  involves writing, testing, and deploying an ERC-721 Token Standard smart contract on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet

**Project Overview:**
- Objective: Gain practical experience with the Ethereum ecosystem, specifically ERC-721 Token Standard smart contracts.
- Purpose: Familiarize with Ethereum and blockchain development for EVM-based Web3 projects, including DAOs and NFTs.

**Background:**
- Deployment on Polygon Mumbai Testnet (part of EVM Ecosystem), using MATIC as the currency.
- Introduction to token standards, focusing on ERC-721 for interoperable applications.

**ERC-721 Token Standard:**
- Definition: A non-fungible token standard widely used in Ethereum for unique tokens.
- Specific methods and events defined for ERC-721 contracts.
- Examples of methods include `balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, and `safeTransferFrom`.
- Examples of events include `Transfer`, `Approval`, and `ApprovalForAll`.

**Set-Up Tasks:**
1. Install MetaMask for connecting to Polygon Mumbai Network.
2. Configure Polygon Mumbai Testnet on MetaMask.
3. Acquire MATIC using Polygon Mumbai Testnet Faucet.
4. Utilize Remix IDE and Solidity for smart contract development.
5. Understand and use IPFS for storing files and images.

Project Tasks:

Task 1 - Complete the getDeviceByKey function:
Objective: Retrieve a device record by its composite key (device_serial and price).
Functionality: Complete the code for the getDeviceByKey function to return the device record based on the composite key.

Task 2 - Complete getter and setter methods for the lastUpdate field:
Objective: Implement lastUpdate field for DeviceRecord.
Functionality: Create setlastUpdate and getlastUpdate functions to manipulate the lastUpdate field of DeviceRecord.

Task 3 - Complete updateLastUpdate function:
Objective: Update the last update date of a device record.
Functionality: Complete the updateLastUpdate function to update the last update date of a device record.

Task 4 - Complete queryByCompany function:
Objective: Query device records by company.
Functionality: Build an index on the company attribute and complete the queryByCompany function to retrieve records based on the company.

Task 5 - Complete querybyDevice_Type function:
Objective: Query device records by device_type.
Functionality: Build an index on the device_type attribute and complete the querybyDevice_Type function to retrieve records based on device_type.

Task 6 - Complete querybyDevice_Type_Dual function:
Objective: Query device records by two device types.
Functionality: Build an index on two device types and complete the querybyDevice_Type_Dual function to retrieve records with the specified device types.

Task 7 - Complete the unknownTransaction function:
Objective: Handle unknown transactions.
Functionality: Implement the unknownTransaction function to throw an error message when a non-existent function is called.

This project offers practical learning in blockchain development, focusing on ERC-721 token contracts and the Polygon Mumbai Testnet.
